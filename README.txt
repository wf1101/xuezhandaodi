This hackathon is to explore the mobile game development and make a simple game for fun.

The flow is: 

1. player clicks a cell. 

2. player clicks another cell. 

3. if the two cells can connect within three lines, two numbers divide by their greatest common devisor. 

4. if the result is 1, the cell becomes empty and accessible. 

5. make all cells to be 1. game over. 



There are a few difficulties: 

1. it could be only 1 number (not 1) left on the board, in that case, game will never end. 

2. it could be four numbers attached each other left on the board, like 

47 5

5 47 



in this case, game will never end. 47 or 5 needs more than 3 lines to connect a target.
